## Explanation of files and folders.
The main folders for this project thus far are
- workflows
- project-plan-files

Workflows simply houses the files we are going to use for the testing component of our CI/CD process.

The project-plan-files folder will have all the files related to milestone 1, which is the initial project planning phase. Each file's purpose/meaning is as follows:
- **DFD.png** is an image which shows the Data Flow Diagram created to represent a potential users process through using our web application.
